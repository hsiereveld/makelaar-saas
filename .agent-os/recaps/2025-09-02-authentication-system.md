# [2025-09-02] Recap: Authentication System Implementation

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-authentication-system/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive authentication system with JWT-based auth, tenant claims, and role-based permissions for the makelaar-saas multi-tenant CRM platform. The implementation established a complete authentication foundation with user management, session handling, and security measures. All authentication operations now support multi-tenant isolation with extensive role-based access control and secure session management.

- **Authentication Database Schema**: Complete user, session, account, and permission tables with proper relationships and tenant associations
- **Authentication Service Layer**: AuthService, UserService, and PermissionService with registration, login, and role management
- **Authentication APIs**: Complete registration, login, session management, and user profile endpoints
- **Security Features**: BCrypt password hashing, JWT tokens, session validation, and refresh token rotation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical permission system with tenant-specific user roles
- **Authentication Middleware**: Route protection with session validation and role-based permissions

## Context

Build a complete authentication system that handles user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control with proper tenant isolation and security. The core objective was to implement JWT-based authentication with tenant claims and role-based permissions, providing secure access control for the multi-tenant CRM platform.
