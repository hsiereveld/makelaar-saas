This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-02-property-status-workflow/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully implemented a comprehensive property lifecycle management system with status transitions, workflow automation, and business rule enforcement for the makelaar-saas platform.

- **Workflow Service Layer**: PropertyWorkflowService, WorkflowRuleService, and WorkflowTriggerService with state machine validation
- **Workflow APIs**: Property status updates, workflow history, automation triggers, and analytics endpoints
- **Business Rules Engine**: Configurable rules with conditions, role requirements, and priority ordering
- **Automation System**: Event-based and time-based triggers with action execution and retry logic
- **Integration**: Complete integration with property and contact management systems for notifications
