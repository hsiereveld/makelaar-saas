# [2025-09-01] Recap: Database Integration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-database-integration/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully transformed the makelaar-saas platform from mock data to a fully database-integrated multi-tenant CRM system. The implementation established a robust foundation with complete PostgreSQL integration, service layer architecture, and comprehensive multi-tenant data isolation. All API endpoints now use real database operations with proper error handling, validation, and tenant security.

- **Database Connection & Services**: Implemented Drizzle ORM connection with service layer pattern for properties and tenants
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: Complete tenant data isolation with comprehensive testing across all CRUD operations
- **API Integration**: Updated all property management endpoints to use database with full error handling
- **Test Coverage**: 30 passing tests covering database operations, service layer, API routes, and tenant isolation
- **Development Tools**: Added demo data seeding, Vitest testing framework, and type-safe database operations

## Context

Transform the current mock-data-driven property management system into a fully database-integrated CRM with real data persistence, multi-tenant isolation, and robust CRUD operations. The core objective was to replace mock data with real PostgreSQL database integration throughout the platform, establishing the foundation for multi-tenant CRM functionality with database-backed property CRUD operations, complete contact and lead management system, and database-driven tenant settings and customization system.
