# Product Mission (Lite)

Makelaar CRM SaaS is a complete multi-tenant CRM application that helps Dutch, English, and Belgian real estate professionals operating in Spain manage international property transactions, leads, and cross-border client relationships through comprehensive web interfaces that serve all parties in the real estate process.

Makelaar CRM serves Northern European real estate agents and agencies specializing in Spanish properties for international buyers who need multilingual CRM capabilities (Dutch, English, French, Spanish) with a complete application interface for business management. Unlike traditional real estate software designed for domestic markets, we provide a comprehensive CRM application with full frontend interfaces for makeleaars to manage their business and for buyers, sellers, and other parties to execute their roles in property transactions. The platform offers true multi-tenant architecture with pan-European features like multi-currency support (EUR/GBP), international transaction workflows, and multi-jurisdiction compliance management, while allowing API integration with makeleaars' separate marketing websites.
