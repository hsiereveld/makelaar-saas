# Comprehensive Stamdata Management System

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Transform all hardcoded dropdowns, checklists, and categorizations into a fully configurable tenant-specific stamdata management system, enabling makelaars to customize their CRM based on their Spanish real estate specialization.

**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for professional makelaar customization and scalability

## Problem Statement

Currently, all property types, Spanish regions, amenities, client types, and other categorizations are hardcoded in frontend components. This prevents makelaars from:
- Specializing in specific property types (villa-only, apartment-only)
- Focusing on specific Spanish regions (Costa Blanca specialist vs Costa del Sol)
- Customizing amenities based on their client preferences
- Creating their own client segmentation and lead sources
- Adapting the system to their unique business model

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Foundation Completed:**
- Database schema for stamdata management implemented
- Tenant stamdata CRUD interface built
- Dynamic form system replacing hardcoded values
- Stamdata service layer completed

ðŸš§ **Phase 2.1 Remaining:**
- Platform admin template management system
- One-click template import for tenants
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Template analytics and usage tracking

## User Stories

### Platform Admin Stories
- As a platform admin, I want to create stamdata templates based on successful makelaars so new agencies can quick-start with proven configurations
- As a platform admin, I want to analyze which stamdata items are most popular to improve default templates

### Makelaar/Agency Stories

- As a makelaar, I want to add my own property amenities and client tags that aren't in standard templates

### End User Stories
- As an agent, I want property creation forms that show only relevant options for our agency's focus

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
```sql
-- Tenant-specific master data
tenant_master_data (
  tenantId, category, key, label, labelEn, icon, description, 
  sortOrder, isActive, isDefault, isPopular, metadata
)

-- Template system
platform_stamdata_templates (
  id, name, description, templateData, createdBy, usageCount
)

-- Extended property/client data
property_extended_data (extensive Spanish property features)
client_extended_data (Dutch buyer segmentation)
```
