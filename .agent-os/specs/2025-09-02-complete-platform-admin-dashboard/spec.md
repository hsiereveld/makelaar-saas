## User Stories

### Super-Admin Agency Management

As a **Platform Super-Admin**, I want to manage all real estate agencies on the platform with complete oversight of their subscriptions, usage, and business metrics, so that I can operate a profitable SaaS business with full control over customer success and revenue optimization.

**Detailed Workflow:**

2. Create new agencies with subscription plan assignment and trial period setup
3. Manage existing agencies by suspending/activating accounts, upgrading plans, and reviewing usage
4. Monitor platform-wide KPIs including revenue, user growth, and support metrics
5. Handle billing operations including invoice management, payment tracking, and subscription modifications

### SaaS Team Collaboration

As a **SaaS Team Member** (billing_admin, support_admin), I want to access specific platform management functions based on my role, so that I can efficiently perform my responsibilities without access to sensitive areas outside my domain.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Login with role-based permissions that show/hide appropriate dashboard sections
2. Billing admins manage subscriptions, invoices, and payment operations
3. Support admins handle tickets, user assistance, and customer communication
4. All actions are logged for audit trails and compliance tracking
5. Collaborate with team through shared analytics and communication tools

### Agency Analytics & Support

As a **Platform Operator**, I want comprehensive analytics and support tools to monitor agency health and provide proactive customer success, so that I can maximize retention and identify growth opportunities.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Monitor real-time usage metrics across all agencies with trend analysis
2. Identify agencies approaching subscription limits or showing declining usage
3. Manage support tickets with priority assignment and resolution tracking
4. Generate financial reports for business planning and investor updates
5. Export data for external analytics and business intelligence tools
