# Authentication System Implementation - Spec Summary

## Overview
Implement comprehensive authentication system with JWT-based auth, tenant claims, and role-based permissions for the makelaar-saas multi-tenant CRM platform.

## Core Objective
Build a complete authentication system that handles user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control with proper tenant isolation and security.

## Key Deliverables
- **User Database Schema**: Complete user models with tenant associations and role management
- **Authentication API**: Registration, login, logout, and session management endpoints
- **JWT Token System**: Secure token generation with tenant claims and role-based permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Permission system for different user roles (admin, agent, viewer, etc.)
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: User isolation and tenant-specific authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with refresh tokens and expiration

## Success Criteria
- User registration and login working with proper validation
- JWT tokens include tenant claims and role-based permissions
- Role-based access control enforced across all API endpoints
- Multi-tenant user isolation working correctly
- Session management with secure token refresh
- Authentication middleware protecting all tenant-specific routes
- Comprehensive test coverage for all authentication flows

## Technical Approach
- Use better-auth library for authentication foundation
- Extend existing database schema with user and session tables
- Implement JWT tokens with custom tenant and role claims
- Create authentication middleware for API route protection
- Build role-based permission system for different user types
- Integrate with existing multi-tenant architecture
- Provide secure session management with refresh token rotation
